# E-commerce Product Page - React.js & Next.js

This project was developed as part of a technical assignment for a React.js position at Appscrip. The task was to create a functional, responsive e-commerce product page using React.js and Next.js, pulling in product data from the FakeStoreAPI.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive, optimized for both mobile and tablet screens.
- **API Integration**: Utilized [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch and display product data.
- **Next.js**: Implemented the project with Next.js, leveraging its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- **Code Quality**: Focused on maintaining clean code with proper structure, meaningful naming conventions, and minimized DOM size.
